# Contributing to this blog


* **Open an issue**, If you can, **please provide a fix and create a pull request (PR) instead**; this will automatically create an issue for you.
* Issues will be closed if they appear stale or are too vague - please don't take this personally! 
Please feel free to re-open issues I closed if there's something I missed and they still need to be addressed.

You can even help me write the `Contributing guidelines` :)
